# youtube-dlp-scripts
**[Youtube-DLP] (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) Scripts that will pretty much replace any downloader that exists out here.**

I made the scripts because there weren't any scripts that are easy enough to understand for the general public.
I think the original conf file is from another repository, but I can't remember from which one because it's from 2020 lol.
