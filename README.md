# **quyu's yt-dlp script pack**

_The repository is under rework, so if there's something missing, sorry!_

These are [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) scripts that should be easy to understand and user-friendly.

List of scripts:
- **Channel** - main script for downloading stuff (YouTube and every supported yt-dlp site)
- **Channel - Archive** - scripts for downloading stuff from archive.org (archived YouTube pages)
- **Channel - Default Template** - script for downloading stuff with yt-dlp's default template (ex. Video Name [Video ID].mp4)
- **Livestream** - scripts for downloading livestreams in real-time (mainly youtube livestreams)
- **PlaylistMP3** - scripts for downloading music playlists
- **Twitch Clips** - scripts for downloading Twitch clips

Make sure to keep yt-dlp up-to-date!
