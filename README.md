# Youtube-DLP Scripts
**[Youtube-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) Scripts that will pretty much replace any downloader that exists out here.**

I made the scripts because there weren't any scripts that are easy enough to understand for the general public.
I think the original conf file is from another repository, but I can't remember from which one because it's from 2020 and my friend gave me it lol.
If you have any questions make sure you read the guides included in the released scripts.


Why not [Youtube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)? Because Youtube-DLP in general has more features and supported websites than Youtube-DL.
