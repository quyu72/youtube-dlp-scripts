# **quyu's yt-dlp script pack**

The repository is under rework, so if there's something missing, sorry!

These are [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) scripts written in batch that should be easy to understand and user-friendly.

List of scripts:
- "Channel" - the main script for downloading stuff
- "Channel - Achive" - slightly rewritten "Channel" scripts for downloading stuff from archive.org
- "Channel - Default Template" - uses the default template to download stuff
- "Livestream" - scripts for downloading livestream in real-time (mainly youtube livestreams)
- "PlaylistMP3" - script (mainly) for downloading music playlists
- "Twitch Clips" - scripts for downloading Twitch clips
